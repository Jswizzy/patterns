Overview:
  Transverse a container
  doesn't expose underlying structure
  decouples data from algorithms
  sequential
  concurrent modification
  efficient way to traverse
  algorithm
  foreach syntax

examples:
  java util iterator
  java util enumeration

design:
  interface based
  factory method based
  independent, but fail fast
  enumerators are fail safe
  iterator, concrete iterator

Pitfalls:
  no random access
  directional
  speed / efficiency
