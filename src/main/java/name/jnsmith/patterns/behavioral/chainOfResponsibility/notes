Overview:
  decouple the sender and receiver
  receiver contains reference to next receiver
  promotes lose coupling
  may not be a handler
  runtime configuration
  hierarchical in nature

examples:
  java util logger
  servlet filter
  security chain

design:
  chain of receiver objects
  handler is interfaced based
  concrete handler for each implementation
  each handler has a reference to the next
  handler, concrete handler
  handler unique
  successor
  can utilize the command

Pitfalls:
  handling guarantee that everything is handled
  runtime configuration risk
  chain length/performance risk
