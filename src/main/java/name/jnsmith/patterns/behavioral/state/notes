Overview:
  used to represent state in an application
  localize state behavior
  separates what from where
  OCP
  gets rid of large if and else
  interfaced based
  class per state
  transitions
  simplifies cyclomatic complexity
  very similar to strategy almost the same uml

examples:
  none!
  JSF
  Iterator

design:
  Abstract class / interface
  class based
  context unaware
  context, state, concrete state

Pitfalls:
  know your states
  more classes
  keep logic out of context
  state change triggers

use if cycling through states
