Overview:
  runtime
  eliminates conditional statements
  difficult to add new strategies
  behaviour encapsulation
  client aware of strategies
  client choose strategies
  interface based
  algorithms are independent
  class per algorithm

examples:
  java util comparator

design:
  abstract base class
  concrete class per strategy
  strategies are independent
  context, strategy, concrete strategy

Pitfalls:
  client aware of strategies
  have to be chosen
  increased number of classes
