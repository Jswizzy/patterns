Overview:
  code reuse
  common for libraries and frameworks
  IoC (Hollywood principle)
  algorithm emphasis
  allows configuration
  class based not interface based
  compile time not runtime
  same algorithm

examples:
  java util collections sort
  java util abstract

design:
  abstract base class
  bass calls child
  hooks
  operations
  abstract base, concrete class

Pitfalls:
  restrict access
  implement hooks
  confusing hierarchy
  difficult program flow
