Overview:
  handles complex constructors
  can force immutable
  lots of setter or parameters

examples:
  string builder
  document builder
  locale builder

design:
  flexibility over telescoping constructor
  static inner class or part of class it is building
  can have interface but doesn't need one


Pitfalls:
  inner static class
  immutable
  needs to designed first
  complexity
