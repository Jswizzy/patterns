Overview:
  doesn't expose instantiation logic
  defer to subclasses
  common interface
  specifies architecture, implemented by user
  various instances
  multiple constructors
  subclasses
  adaptive
  parameter driven
  solves complexity
  opposite of singleton

examples:
  calendar
  resource bundle
  number format

design:
  factory is responsible for lifecycle
  common interface
  concrete classes
  creation in subclasses

Pitfalls:
  lots of pieces
  complexity
  refactoring not really possible
